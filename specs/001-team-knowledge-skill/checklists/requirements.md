# Specification Quality Checklist: Team Knowledge Skill

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-10-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- FR-014 and SC-004 use a 5-second limit that comes from the constitution (Principle V), not from a technical choice.
- FR-019 and the "any AI assistant" edge case restate Constitution Principle III as user-visible behavior.
- Open choices that were settled earlier (publishing path, CLI scope, source references) are encoded in FR-006, FR-007, FR-010 and the Assumptions section.
